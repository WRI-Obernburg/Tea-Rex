# Tea-Rex
The T-Rex that takes care of your tea-bag-time.... So it's a Tea-Rex.


Initially inspired by the Creator "AchNina" (https://achnina.info/), I wanted to have this Tea-Rex (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IX4Waif7xB8) too. 
Since there weren't any files available I started engineering it myself.
